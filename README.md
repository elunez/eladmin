## Main Features

- Uses the latest tech stack with rich community resources.
- High development efficiency with code generator for one-click front-end and back-end code generation.
- Supports data dictionaries for easy status management.
- API rate limiting to prevent service overload from malicious requests.
- Supports function-level and data-level permissions, with customizable operations.
- Custom permission and anonymous API annotations for quick API interception and release.
- Encapsulates common front-end components: table data requests, data dictionaries, etc.
- Unified exception handling for both front and back ends, avoiding repetitive checks.
- Online user management and server performance monitoring, with single-user login restriction.
- Operations management for easy deployment and management of remote server applications.

## System Functions

- User Management: Configure users; new users default to password `123456`.
- Role Management: Assign permissions and menus, set data permissions by department.
- Menu Management: Dynamic routing, back-end configurable, supports multi-level menus.
- Department Management: Configure system organization structure, tree-shaped table display.
- Position Management: Configure positions for each department.
- Dictionary Management: Maintain common fixed data, such as status and gender.
- System Log: Record user operation logs and exception logs for easy error tracking.
- SQL Monitoring: Use Druid to monitor database access performance, default username `admin`, password `123456`.
- Scheduled Tasks: Integrate Quartz for scheduled tasks, with task logs and task execution status.
- Code Generation: High flexibility code generation for front-end and back-end, reducing repetitive work.
- Email Tool: Send HTML format emails with rich text.
- AWS Cloud Storage: Synchronize AWS cloud storage data to the system, no need to log in to AWS cloud to operate cloud data.
- Alipay Payment: Integrate Alipay payment and provide a test account for self-testing.
- Server Monitoring: Monitor server load status.
- Operations Management: One-click deployment of your application.

## Project Structure

The project uses a modular development approach, with the following structure:

- `eladmin-common`: System public module, including various utility classes and public configurations.
- `eladmin-system`: System core module and project entry module, also the final module to be packaged and deployed.
- `eladmin-logging`: System log module, other modules need to import this module to record logs.
- `eladmin-tools`: Third-party tool module, including email, AWS cloud storage, local storage
- `eladmin-generator`: System code generation module, supporting front-end and back-end CRUD code generation.
